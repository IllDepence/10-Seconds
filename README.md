Someone tied a bomb onto you and two precious friends are about to visit. Prevent their death and you'll be sent back to the living. Unfortunately, people seem to misunderstand your reincarnation resulting in an evergrowing popularity of your person. Even when you're sent back to the most remote and bizarre places there's always at least one fruitcake trying to get near you.

Followers of the cult forming around your case soon started creating cheesy statues depicting you. Try to stop the madness by taking these symbols of stupidity with you.
